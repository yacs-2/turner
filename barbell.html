		You have reached the end. You began as a simple man, lifting weights to suppress the pain of her memory. She didn't mean to hurt you, and you didn't ever mean to make her cry. But she hurt you. You made her cry. That makes you no better than the dirty ground you walk on to most people. You are misunderstood. But we understand you. We truly do. You will continue to lift weights. You unlocked William, which is the key to an unmeasurable amount of ways you can become better. Become stronger. Become a better gym bro. No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to get her smile out of your head. Never. It will always live in your head to remind you of the pain you caused her. Like we said, you didn't mean to, but if you hit someone with your car, and didn't mean to, what difference does it make? You killed a man, and it was your fault. Same here. You broke her heart, no excuse will heal it. You have the power of wrist straps, pump covers, dad music, William, pre, protein, creatine, and so much more. Use these to become the monster she created. Don't bow down to societal norms, become a statistical outlier. Do the things, no one else had the balls to do. Become a gym rat. You will become a gym rat. You will meet us <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/1379+W+C+St,+Wilmington,+CA+90744/@33.7718566,-118.280935,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80dd360a8251c467:0xeeac54317473ef4f!8m2!3d33.7718522!4d-118.2783601?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" style="text-decoration: none;">here</a> on December 31st, at 11:34 PM, no earlier no later. We want you to look up the significance of this location, and you will understand everything. Without men like you sir, this world would be full of scrawny slaves to society, destroying themselves to feed the pit of desparity and worthlessness society drags with it. You will break the chain. Welcome, my friend, to the <span style="font-size: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px;">League Of GymBros</span>
