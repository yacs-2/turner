  <blockquote style="margin-left:500px;margin-right:500px; text-align:center">
    <span style="font-family:; ">In Gotham's heart, where shadows grow,
A city haunted, cursed below,
A storm tore through the moonlit night,
An apocalypse, an endless fight.
The streets, once safe, now filled with screams,
The living lost in terror's dreams,
Zombies lurked in every street,
With hunger sharp, and endless heat.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-size:large;font-family:georgia;">Yet in this chaos, dark and wild, A flicker of hope, soft and mild—
A baby kitten, pure and small,
With fur as white as heaven's call.
Alone it mewed, a fragile thing,
Lost in the wreckage of the suffering.
Its eyes, like orbs of liquid fear,
  Yet still it fought, and drew so near.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-family:monospace;">From shadows deep, the bat emerged,
His cape a wave of vengeance surged.
Batman, the guardian of the night,
A warrior clad in armor's might,
With fists that crushed the wicked soul,
And rage that could devour whole.
He saw the kitten, helpless, small,
  Its innocence amid the fall.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-family:consolas;font-variant:small-caps;font-size:x-large;">"Stay back, little one, don't stray too near,
The darkness here will steal your cheer,"
His voice was gravel, hoarse with pain,
But his heart, it called to break the chain.
A final breath of life he’d take,
To shield this soul for mercy's sake.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-family:'lucida console';font-weight:bold;">The zombies came, their jaws like stone,
Their flesh a rotting, hollow tone.
But Batman fought, with fury red,
His knuckles cracked, his veins, they bled.
He twisted, turned, and broke their bones,
With every punch, their cries did moan.
But still, they came—an endless tide,
More and more, from every side.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-weight:light;font-family">He held the kitten close to his chest,
A fleeting hope in his final quest.
His arms, though weary, clung so tight,
For he would give all to keep it right.
He tossed the kitten to a roof,
His voice a growl, a broken proof:
“Run, little one, get far away!
This is the end, the final fray.”</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-style:oblique">But as he turned, a scream did tear,
A gnarled hand grasped him in despair.
A claw-like talon, sharp and vile,
Sank deep into the Bat's last smile.
The dark knight grunted, twisted, turned,
And with a strike, his fury burned.
But more hands seized, and pulled him down,
A sea of death in this forsaken town.</span><br><br>

  <span style="">The kitten cried, its mew a wail,
As Batman’s strength began to pale.
His breath was ragged, his vision blurred,
A final blow was soon incurred.
The zombies gnawed, a savage feast,
  But Batman fought, his will increased.</span><br><br>

  <span style="font-family:monospace;">Then with a crash, the Bat did fall,
A hero slain, yet standing tall.
His cape, his armor—ripped and torn,
In blood and ash, his soul reborn.
He closed his eyes as shadows grew,
And whispered, “Gotham... this... is... you.”</span><br><br>

  <span style="text-decoration:underline blue 1px">The kitten watched with silent paws,
Its tiny heart a mirror's pause.
And though the night consumed the light,Batman had saved it from the fight.A final breath, a final cry,
As Gotham’s dark knight said goodbye.</span><br><br>
